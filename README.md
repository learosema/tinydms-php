tinydms-php is a work-in-progress microservice for a simple document management system based on the [Slim Framework](https://slimframework.com).

## Requirements

* PHP 5.5+

## Specs

* Coming soon.

## Running the application

Before you can run the application, you have to install the dependencies via `composer install`.

To start a development server at http://localhost:8080/, type `composer start`. 

The application uses PHP's built-in development web server and a flat file database using SQLite.
So, you don't need to setup Apache/MySQL/whatever on your development machine.
